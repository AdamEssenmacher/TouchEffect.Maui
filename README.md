# Maui.TouchEffect
Forked from the amazingly popular original TouchEffect Library, this Compat version aims to ease your migration from Xamarin.Forms to .NET MAUI with a compatible implementation to get you up and running without rewriting the parts of your app that relied on the original library.

Get it from NuGet:

[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/TouchEffect.Maui.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TouchEffect.Maui)

> The aim of this library is to provide temporary support for the touch effect without having to take a dependency on [XCT's MauiCompat](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/introducing-net-maui-compatibility-for-the-xamarin-community-toolkit/) library. My results of using the compat library have been extremely tempramental, alot of the times the touch effect does not work and due to the packages target framework (net6) & age (2 years old) I figured a new port would be the best option. When [CommunityToolkit.Maui](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui) eventually releases this feature I will archive this repository.

This library supports the following platforms:

| Platform     | Supported |
| ------------ | --------- |
| iOS          | ‚úÖ         |
| Android      | ‚úÖ         |
| Mac Catalyst | ‚ùå         |
| Windows      | ‚ùå         |
| Tizen        | ‚ùå         |

Due to the temporary nature of this library, I will not be adding support for any platforms I do not personally need. I am open to PR's but MCT are aiming for a NET8 release of TouchEffect so this library will only be kicking around for a matter of weeks/months.

## Install

- Install TouchEffect.Maui package
- 
 ```
 Install-Package TouchEffect.Maui -Version 7.0.0
 ```

- In your `MauiProgram.cs`, call `UseMauiTouchEffect`:
  ```diff
  var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
          builder
              .UseMauiApp<App>()
  ++          .UseMauiTouchEffect()
              .ConfigureFonts(fonts =>
              {
                  fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Regular.ttf", "OpenSansRegular");
                  fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Semibold.ttf", "OpenSansSemibold");
              });
  ```

## Usage

See the samples app from this project, it is a port of the `TouchEffectPage` from the XCT samples app.

    TouchEffect.PressedOpacity="0.6"
    TouchEffect.PressedScale="0.8"
    HorizontalOptions="CenterAndExpand"
